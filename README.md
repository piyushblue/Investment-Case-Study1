# Investment-Case-Study Project
Spark Funds wants to make investments in a few companies. The CEO of Spark Funds wants to understand the global trends in investments so that she can take the investment decisions effectively.

Goals of data analysis: Your goals are divided into three sub-goals:
Investment type analysis: Understanding investments in the venture, seed/angel, private equity categories, etc. so Spark Funds can decide which type is best suited for its strategy.
Country analysis: Understanding which countries have had the most investments in the past. These will be Spark Funds’ favourites as well.
Sector analysis: Understanding the distribution of investments across the eight main sectors. (Note that we are interested in the eight main sectors provided in the mapping file. The two files — companies and rounds2 — have numerous sub-sector names; hence, you will need to map each sub-sector to its main sector.)

Spark Funds has two minor constraints for investments:

It wants to invest between 5 to 15 million USD per round of investment
It wants to invest only in English-speaking countries because of the ease of communication with the companies it would invest in
